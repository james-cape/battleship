  #### Ranges
  def test_range_exists

    range = 3..8

    actual = range.class
    assert_equal expected, actual
  end


  def test_array_object

  def test_array_also_works_with_strings
    skip

    skip
    range = "A".."D"

    expected = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
    actual = range.to_a
    assert_equal expected, actual
  end

#### Ordinal values
# The Range with Strings works because each character has an implicit value that tells us in what order the characters should be. This is called the Ordinal Value, and you can access it with the ord method for Strings:

  def test_verify_ordinal_value
    skip
    expected = 65
    actual = "A".ord
    assert_equal expected, actual
  end

  def test_verify_another_ordinal_value
    skip
    expected = 68
    actual = "D".ord
    assert_equal expected, actual
  end

#### Helpful Enumerables
## Ruby has an enumerable method called each_cons that allows you to access consecutive elements in a collection. See the Ruby Docs for more details.
##
## Also consider if the enumerables any?, all?, none? would be helpful.


#### Placing Ships
  def test_same_ship_is_on_cell_2_and_cell_3
    skip
    @board.place(@cruiser, ["A1", "A2", "A3"])
    @cell_1.ship
    @cell_2.ship
    @cell_3.ship

    expected = true
    actual = @cell_3.ship == @cell_2.ship
    assert_equal expected, actual
  end

#### Overlapping Ships
  def test_ships_cannot_overlap
    skip
    @board.place(@cruiser, ["A1", "A2", "A3"])
    @cell_1.ship
    @cell_2.ship
    @cell_3.ship

    expected = false
    actual = @board.valid_placement?(@submarine, ["A1", "B1"])
    assert_equal expected, actual
  end

#### Rendering the Board
## Rendering the Board
## Our board needs to be able to render a String representation of itself to display to the user all of its cells in a formatted grid. Each Cell should be displayed using the rules from Iteration 1:
##
## ”.” if the cell has not been fired upon.
## “M” if the cell has been fired upon and it does not contain a ship (the shot was a miss).
## “H” if the cell has been fired upon and it contains a ship (the shot was a hit).
## “X” if the cell has been fired upon and its ship has been sunk. Note that all of the cells that contain that sunken ship should render as an “X”, not just the cell that resulted in the ship being sunk.
## And just like with cells, we will include an optional argument to indicate whether we want to show hidden ships.
